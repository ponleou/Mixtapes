## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js (needed for yt-dlp-ejs, helps with playback issues)
- GTK4 (including development headers)
- Libadwaita (including development headers)
- WebKitGTK 6.0 (including development headers)
- GStreamer plugins (base, good, bad, ugly)

## Installation

Currently, there are 4 options for installing Mixtapes:

- AUR
- From Source
- Using a Nix flake
- GitHub Actions (Flatpak)
- Using flatpak-builder

### AUR

If you are using Arch Linux, you can install Mixtapes from the AUR.
An AUR helper like `yay` or `paru` is recommended.

```bash
yay -S mixtapes-git
```

### From Source

Before you start, make sure to install the dependencies.

Here are install commands for some common package managers:

- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S git python-pip nodejs gtk4 libadwaita webkitgtk-6.0 gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly`

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip nodejs libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`

> [!NOTE]
> If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, you should probably use Flatpak to avoid outdated packages.

- Fedora: `sudo dnf install git python3 python3-pip nodejs gtk4-devel adwaita-gtk4-devel webkitgtk6.0-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-bad gstreamer1-plugins-ugly`

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-obeid/Mixtapes.git
   cd Mixtapes
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies within a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

To pull the latest changes:

```bash
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Nix

A Nix flake is available for NixOS or Nix Package Manager users.
See [here](https://github.com/m-obeid/Muse/pull/2#issue-3965386248)

### GitHub Actions (Pre-built Binaries)

Automated builds for Flatpak are available for every change made to the repository. These support both `x86_64` (amd64) and `aarch64` architectures.

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/m-obeid/Muse/actions) on GitHub.
2. Select the latest successful build for "Build Flatpak".
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section and download the file for your architecture.

**For Flatpak:**

You can quickly add the automated repository to receive updates by running:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists mixtapes https://m-obeid.github.io/Mixtapes/mixtapes.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user mixtapes com.pocoguy.Muse
```

> [!NOTE]
> Recently, the repository name was changed from "Muse" to "Mixtapes".
> If you are updating from an older version, you might need to remove the old repository first:
> `flatpak remote-delete --user mixtapes`

_(Alternatively, you can download the offline bundle file:)_

```bash
unzip Mixtapes-x86_64-flatpak.zip
flatpak install --user ./Mixtapes-x86_64.flatpak
```

### Flatpak

1. Install Flatpak and required runtimes:

   ```bash
   flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//49 org.gnome.Sdk//49 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node24//24.08
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-obeid/Mixtapes.git
   cd Mixtapes
   ```

3. Build and install:

   ```bash
   flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir com.pocoguy.Muse.yaml
   ```

4. Run:
   ```bash
   flatpak run com.pocoguy.Muse
   ```

## Authentication

> [!NOTE]
> You can now authenticate using the app itself through an embedded WebKit browser!
> Below are the old, manual instructions.

This app uses `ytmusicapi` for backend data. Authentication allows access to your library and higher quality streams.

To authenticate, you need to generate a `browser.json` file.

- Run: `ytmusicapi browser`
- Follow instructions to log in via your browser and paste the headers. It is recommended to use a private browser profile for this, so that you don't get logged out of the account from the app.
- The output will be saved as `browser.json` in the project root directory.

**Flatpak:** Open your browser, go to YouTube Music, and copy request headers as described [here](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/browser.html).
Then run `flatpak run --command=sh com.pocoguy.Muse` and inside the shell run `mkdir -p ~/data/Muse && cd ~/data/Muse && ytmusicapi browser`.
Paste the headers and press Ctrl-D.

If you don't have a `browser.json` file, the app will use the unauthenticated API, which can cause playback issues.

The OAuth flow is currently borked in `ytmusicapi`, don't use it. I removed it from the app, but there might be some leftover code.
